Understanding Hypertension Through Data ðŸ§ ðŸ’‰

As a data analyst, I recently explored a synthetic dataset that mirrors real-world health challenges â€” particularly hypertension â€” a silent but deadly condition affecting millions globally.

ðŸ”Ž Through analysis, i uncovered key insights:
 â€¢ Individuals with high BMI, poor sleep, and high salt intake had a noticeably higher hypertension risk.
 â€¢ Smoking, low exercise levels, and high stress scores were strong predictors.
 â€¢ A family history of hypertension significantly increased individual risk.

ðŸ“ˆ Using these insights, I proposed solutions:
 â€¢ Promote public awareness of diet, exercise, and stress management.
 â€¢ Encourage early screenings, especially for those with a family history.

This project demonstrates how data can drive better health decisions even when using synthetic data. Itâ€™s not just about predictions; itâ€™s about prevention.
